Usage: solver.py
Assumes: 
1. python is installed on the system at /usr/bin/python
2. puzzle.txt file exists in the same directory. This is a 9x9 sudoku puzzle. 
   x stands for blank and 1..9 for the value in the square.

Browsing hints:
1. best viewed by setting tabstop to 2. (I know this is not universally liked)

Limitations:
1. No adversarial testing has been done.
2. The function puzzleBoxPossibleValues needs to be implemented. The solver has
   been able to solve all the puzzles so far, so I have left this for future.
